## General info

Sun vs Cloudator was created as second project during [GameDev School]( https://gds.gamedevschool.pl/ ) course. We worked in four person team and completed it in two months. It was a first project which we had to complete by ourself. During production we create five gameplay mechani prototypes and selected best in our opinion.

## Game Description
This is the endless game which shows us an adventure of a Sunny the Sun who is
flying across the sky, trying to avoid the clouds which are trying to make bad
weather and running away from the angry super cloud who’s name is Cloudator. The
game was inspired by the good warm summer weather which is usually the favorite
one for most of us. Ironically, nothing lasts forever, so in a game, as a brave sun, we
are trying to prolong the good mood for everyone as long as we can. And even if
eventually we fail - the sun will shine on us again!
